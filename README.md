# project-euler
Python solutions to Project Euler. Ongoing project.

---
This repository contains v1neethnc's solutions for Project Euler questions. All the solutions are written are in Python.

As of this moment, there are 88 solutions. Most of the codes have a basic idea of the solution explained. For the rest, the solution is more detailed, as there are greater nuances to take care of. For some codes, the description is still being added as they were not originally written, so I have to actively go back to each code and see what my approach to the question is.

As you might see in the solutions, some of them were written years ago, when I was barely a year into learning how to code. Therefore, a lot of the codes contain redundant code, bad approach to the problem, inefficient implementation, or a combination of some or all of them. I could change them, but I personally think of this project as a way to keep track of my coding journey, which is why I'm leaving them intact.

The numerical solutions and the running times of each code are present in two separate files respectively.
